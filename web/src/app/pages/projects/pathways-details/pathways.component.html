    <!-- Overview -->
    <h3 id="overview" class="text-[1.5em] text-primary section">Overview</h3>
    <p>SCALE Pathways is a web application for prospective students to explore universities and build sample schedules using real course data and dependencies. This project was originally created by me and two other developers as part of our senior design project for Washington State University. Since completing the prototype and graduating in December 2020, I have stayed on with SCALE to act as a technical mentor for future senior design teams as they continue to build upon Pathways. Most recently I have played a major role in getting the current version of the application deployed and publically available on the web.</p>
